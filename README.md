# RRMod_PuzzleFix
RRMod_PuzzleFix is a .pak mod for Islands of Insight, which is a part of the "Offline Restored Mod", a community driven bugfix and QoL patch.
For the full Offline Restored Mod, this .pak mod is packaged in conjunction with a .dll mod within the releases.
[Source code for the .dll mod](https://github.com/grechnik/islands-of-insight-fix)

The mod does not affect your save file in any way. All progress is shared between vanilla and modded game.

## Latest Release
See [here](https://github.com/RiccTheThicc/RRMod_Puzzlefix/releases) to download the latest release of the mod, and see the latest features.

## Key Features
- All puzzles now stay solved permanently.*
- All puzzles should now spawn in properly and match daily counts.
- Restored 50+ broken sentinel stone puzzles.
- Fixed dozens of missing, broken, and stuck-in-wall puzzles.
- You can actually 100% the game now.
- Tripled the spawnpoints for "cluster" logic grids (east of lucent fast travel, bent into shape, nearsighted).
- Superjump cooldown reduced from 300 to 60 seconds.*
- Implemented automatic save file backups.*
- Fixed the positions of all floor slabs.
- All flow orbs always display your all-time best.*
- All glide rings remember your actual best score.*
- Enabled more rare skydrop shapes.

*Feature implemented in .dll mod. Some .dll mod features can be disabled/adjusted in dxgi.ini

## Known issues
Daily quests, farming sparks, and XP levelling don't fit well with perma-solvable puzzles - there's no easy way to have both.
We recommend focusing on just solving unique puzzles and enjoying the actual content.

If you still would like to grind for all cosmetics and masteries, you can disable this feature by setting SolvedStaySolved to 0 within the dxgi.ini file.
This re-enables vanilla behavior of puzzles not staying solved past the current game session, but keeps all other mod's fixes (with the exception of Flow Orbs times, see below).
Your progress will not be lost with the feature disabled, and you can re-enable it by setting SolvedStaySolved to 1 at any time.

Other minor issues the mod doesn't fix:
- Some puzzles still belong to the wrong zone (e.g. a particular verdant glide ring located in autumn).
- With SolvedStaySolved disabled, Flow Orbs overwrite your historical best upon re-solving them.
- Skydrop speed challenge overwrites your historical best with current run (modded and vanilla both).
- Superjumps can still fail occasionally.

## Credits
The great majority of the work on this .pak mod, especially so after the initial release, was done by Rushin', along with some help from myself.
The accompanied .dll mod, which made much of what the Offline Restored Mod does possible, was made by Meltdown.

The mod would be far from what it is currently without the amazing community around Islands of Insight.

## Basic Methodology
RRMod_PuzzleFix is a "Pak" mod, meaning it is a modification of the .pak files found in Unreal Engine games. The mod does not alter the vanilla files on your disk in any way.

Pak files are just a compressed version of the game's asset files (.uasset, .uexp, and .umap) that Unreal Engine uses to load textures, meshes, blueprints, and other data into the game.
The .json files in this project are just easily readable/editable versions of these asset files, converted to .json files via the [UAssetGUI tool](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI).

All the mod is doing is loading altered asset files into the game *after* the vanilla assets are loaded, which overwrites the vanilla functionality with the one we want. This is how the vanilla game files are able to remain unaffected.

### Getting the jsons
In order to mod the .pak files, we need to unpack them first to get at the asset files within.
I've created another repository to store all of the vanilla game's unpacked asset files, so you never have to go through the trouble of doing so yourself.
See: [IslandsOfInsight-Unpacked-Assets](https://github.com/RiccTheThicc/IslandsOfInsight-Unpacked-Assets)
In case you would like to follow our process from scratch, that repo also contains information about how you can unpack the files yourself.

Once we have the asset files, we can edit them directly with [UAssetGUI](https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI), but for some files we need to create bulk edits that would be difficult to do by hand, so we convert them to .json files.
To do this, open the .uasset/.umap file in UAssetGUI with File -> Open, and then save the file as a .json with File -> Save As. When saving/opening the file as a .json UAssetGUI takes care of the conversion for you.

### Alterations
After the assets are converted to .json files, we run them through a program that cleans up the binary data used by the puzzles within the game.
The asset files themselves contain some raw binary data, but this doesn't play nice with the programs we want to use to manipulate the text of the files, so we load them into memory and then write them back to disk to convert all the binary data into standard unicode characters.
The game reads these characters exactly the same way it would the binary data, so no game functionality is affected by this change. The main reason this is done as its own step is to avoid there being strange diffs within the binary data.

Once we have the clean .jsons, we make the "Base jsons". These are the files that the ModMaker program will work from.
Any changes from the vanilla jsons to the base jsons are relatively small in quantity or would be tedious to code (like addition or removal of objects) and are done by hand.
Some examples of this are adding or changing the zone affiliation of puzzle containers.

The majority of the changes are then added to the jsons programmatically by our ModMaker tool.
"ModMaker/modmaker.bat" is run to convert the "Base jsons" into the "Output jsons". Currently only two files are edited by this program, PuzzleDatabase.json and SandboxZones.json.
These two files are quite large, which makes their information difficult to parse, so the program also produces readable versions of them split into multiple smaller files.

### Building the pak
I'm currently working on a tool to streamline this process, so you can just run an .exe file to convert from .json to .pak directly, but for now only an explanation for how to compile the source is provided:

To take the source code in this repository and create a pak mod, you first need to transform the jsons back into Unreal Engine uasset files.
To do this, simple open the .json within UAssetGUI and save the file.

We can then repack the .Json files using [UnrealPak](https://github.com/allcoolthingsatoneplace/UnrealPakTool).
The asset files retain the folder structure they had when they were packed, and these locations are how the game references the assets themselves. The exact location is determined relative to the directory that the packing took place.
In order to have our .pak replace an asset file in the game's pak on load, we need to make sure it's location is exactly the same as the one within the vanilla file.
The folder structure within this repo is already the one the game uses, so you can simple create the asset files in the same folders the jsons and pak the folder from the correct location. Edit: This is not true for the files within the "Puzzles" folder, but this is fixed in the next version of the mod.

For the version of UE Islands Of Insight was developed with, the packing itself takes place in the Engine/Binaries/Win64 folder within the project root. This results in assets having locations like "..\\..\\..\\IslandsofInsight\\Content\\...", so we pack the IslandsofInsight folder with our new assets from a folder with the same relative location. i.e. The UnrealPak.exe file used for packing is inside "Engine/Binaries/Win64" and the "IslandsofInsight" folder is in the same directory as the "Engine" folder.

The cli command (run within Engine/Binaries/Win64) ends up looking like this:
>./unrealpak RRMod_PuzzleFix.pak -Create="..\..\..\IslandsofInsight\"

Note: The name of the .pak also matters. Paks are loaded in alphabetical order, so since "RRMod..." comes after "pakchunk..." our mod replaces the assets in the vanilla files when the game loads them. There are ways to force load priority outside of alphabetical order, but that is not relevant here.
